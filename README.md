# Mini InstaDogs: Redux

This project is a small app with a login form and a feed of dogs' photos and it uses Redux to manage the global state. The goal of the project was to practice Redux and it's part of the Redux with React course from [Origamid](https://www.origamid.com/curso/redux-com-react/), a Brazilian learning platform. It's a mini version of the [InstaDogs project](https://github.com/julianachagas/instadogs) developed in the React course.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Test Account:

- Login: dog
- Password: dog

The API used in the project (for user authentication and for fetching the photos) was created by Origamid.
